\begin_layout Abstract
At NOAA, I work on hurricane modeling.
 Namely, my job description is to help build capacity for NOAA to quantify
 uncertainty in modeled storm surge caused by a hurricane.
 In the months following a hurricane event, the project seeks to provide
 a confidence level of uncertainty using a combination of operational models
 of the storm state and observational data from sensors taken during the
 storm.
 To this effect, I build ensembles of synthetic storms by perturbing initial
 variables, run the ensemble through operational models, and then build
 a polynomial surrogate model via a regressive learning algorithm that can
 be queried for sensitivities of each variable.
 For my final project, I plan to explore spatial correlation along the ensemble
 space by comparing inundation levels within each modeled outcome.
 I can likely do this via cross-validation along the space of ensembles,
 and / or by extracting spatial autocorrelation metrics of water elevations
 in each perturbed example.

\begin_layout Standard
The coupled model, called ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation) works along an unstructu
red mesh, comprised of points linked by triangular (and sometimes quadrangular)
 cells.
 ADCIRC can output a time series of surface fields, or alternatively individual
 time series at selected points (

stations

\end_inset

), of various output variables including water elevation and water velocity.
 Meanwhile, the data sources involved in the observational data comparison
 include water elevation, water velocity, water salinity, water temperature,
 etc.
 There are surface field observations (from remote sensing imagery) that
 span the entire extent, as well as time series data from individual stations,
 which have relatively high temporal resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think that the simplest option for analysis, and the best option for this
 project, would be to focus on several defined selected station output points
 that have observational data (namely, NOAA CO-OPS tidal stations) and compare
 the water elevation data from the tidal stations and the water elevations
 distribution in the spatial analysis.
